# **App Name**: CalcForge

## Core Features:

- Calculator Creation: Enable users to define calculation templates with named variables (hours, weight, item names) and calculation types (time, weight, percentage, fixed price).
- Load Calculator Templates: Enable users to load existing calculator templates that they have already created.
- Line Calculation: Calculate each line item based on user inputs for defined variables and calculation types in the template.
- Percentage Calculation: Calculate percentage-based costs derived from values in selected lines.
- Total Cost Calculation: Calculate the total cost based on all calculated line items.
- Template Saving: Save user-created calculator templates for later use.
- Data Visualization: Visualize the calculated costs using charts and graphs.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated blue (#4285F4), suggesting productivity, trust, and competence.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F4FF), a lighter tint of the primary color to create a clean workspace
- Accent color: Purple (#8E43E7) provides good contrast to the primary, giving important elements a boost of interest and drawing the eye
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for a neutral and objective feel, very appropriate for a calculation environment.
- Use simple, clear icons for calculation types (time, weight, percentage) and actions (save, load, calculate).
- Employ a clean and structured layout for easy input and readability.
- Use subtle animations (e.g., loading spinners, highlighting) to provide feedback and enhance user experience.
- Dark mode: Dark grays and blues for backgrounds, lighter shades for text to reduce eye strain in low-light environments.
